# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
Predict customer churn for a bank using ANNs.

Major concepts dealt with:
- Data preprocessing (categorical/continuous features) and EDA
- Need for stratified sampling while creating training and test sets
- Understanding why scaling and class imbalance corrections should occur after train_test_split
- Class imbalance techniques used: SMOTE, ADASYN (oversampling)
- Feature scaling (min-max), and why we need it
- Checking train and test accuracy with and without handling class imbalance
- Sequential ANN, with experimentation of hyperparameters including choice of optimization techniques
